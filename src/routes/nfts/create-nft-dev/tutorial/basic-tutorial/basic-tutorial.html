                        There is a fee per each token issued, which the issuing account or smart contract must pay. The
                        issuer can choose to pay the fee in one of several different regular Steem Engine token types.
                        Initially, such fees will be payable in ENG or PAL. The issuance fee is calculated as follows:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                <code>fee = base fee + ((base fee) x (number of data properties))</code>

                        The base fee when paying with ENG or PAL is 0.001. The fee reflects the fact that on-chain
                        storage has a cost, so the more data properties an NFT has, the higher the issuance fee will be
                        per token.
                        <br />
                        <strong>Example:</strong> you want to issue 3 tokens and pay the fees in ENG. Your NFT has 4
                        data properties. You will pay 0.005 ENG per token issued (the base fee of 0.001, plus an
                        additional 0.001 for each data property). The total cost to issue 3 tokens will be 0.015 ENG.

                        When a token is issued, the issuer can optionally choose to lock up a basket of other tokens
                        within the issued NFT token (or NFT instance, as we sometimes refer to them). These locked
                        tokens will be transferred from the issuing account or smart contract, and considered "owned" by
                        the newly issued token itself. The locked tokens will stay attached to the issued NFT instance
                        for the duration of its lifetime. Locked tokens cannot be spent or interacted with in any way,
                        they are effectively out of circulation.
                        <br />
                        The only way to retrieve locked tokens is by burning the NFT instance that contains them. When
                        an NFT token is burned, any locked tokens are released & transferred back to the account or
                        smart contract that held the burned token (they are NOT sent back to the issuing account!).
                        <br />
                        Thus locked tokens are a way to give intrinsic value to an NFT, above & beyond what the NFT is
                        worth in its own right. Token holders are incentivized to burn their NFTs in order to get back
                        the value of the tokens locked within.
                        <br />
                        Note that both regular Steem Engine tokens and other NFT instances can be locked within tokens
                        in this manner. You can even have a mix of different token types.

                        Each issued NFT token has its own unique ID number. This ID starts at 1 for each token symbol,
                        and increments by 1 every time a new token is issued. Thus if you issue a new instance of a
                        MYNFT, and the ID of that newly issued token is 501, you know it is the 501st MYNFT to be
                        issued. Token ID numbers can be used to look up data properties through RPC queries, or to
                        identify tokens to be the subject of transfer, burn, delegate, etc actions.
                        <br />
                        Token IDs are always represented as strings when used in arguments to contract actions. Note
                        that ID numbers are not globally unique; they will only be unique for a given symbol (i.e. MYNFT
                        can have a token with id 5, and OTHERNFT can also have a token with id 5). The combination of
