                In the above example, 4 NFT instances are bought at once by @cryptomancer, from separate sellers. Three
                of those tokens were sold by @aggroed, who received a payment of 8.95353150 ENG, and one token was sold
                by @marc who received a payment of 7.60000000 ENG. The total payment amount distributed to the sellers
                for all 4 tokens was 16.55353150 ENG (8.95353150 + 7.60000000), and the market fee was 0.87123850 ENG.
                To get the total sale price of 17.42477000 ENG, add together paymentTotal and feeTotal. In this case,
                the fee for each order was 5%.
