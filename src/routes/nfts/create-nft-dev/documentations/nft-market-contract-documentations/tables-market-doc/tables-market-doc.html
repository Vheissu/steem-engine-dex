                Every NFT symbol has its own separate table to store the sell side order book. The table name for a

                have an NFT called MYNFT, the MYNFTsellBook table will store all active sell orders. Note that this
                table will not exist if the enableMarket action has not been called yet.

                <li>
                    If an NFT instance does not have one of the grouped by data properties set, the grouping will
                    contain an empty string '' for that data property, as in the first example above.

                    Grouping values will always be strings, regardless of the data property type, as shown in the second

            <p class="info">
                We can also infer that the above examples are orders for two different NFT symbols, because the grouped
                by data property names are fixed per symbol according to the setGroupBy action (i.e. grouped by names
                will be the same for all orders of a particular NFT symbol, although of course the data property values
                can vary to distinguish the various groupings).

                Every NFT symbol has its own separate table to store open interest metrics. The table name for a

                Open interest is defined to be the number of currently open (active) orders, grouped according to the
                data property values in each order's grouping field. Note that an open interest entry for a particular
                combination of data property values won't exist until at least 1 order whose NFT instance has that
                combination of values is created. Once created, open interest entries never get deleted. Thus it is
                perfectly reasonable to have an entry with 0 current active orders. <br /><br />
                The open interest count will be incremented as orders are created, and decremented as orders are
                cancelled or filled.

                <strong>Calculating daily volume metrics: </strong> simply sum together the volume field for all trade
                history entries in the table, querying by priceSymbol if desired, to get the total number of NFT
                instances traded. Similarly, sum together the price field to get total value exchanged. Note that price
                is stored as a string, so you must convert to a floating point number in order to calculate the sum.
