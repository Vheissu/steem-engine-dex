                The crittermanager contract serves as a reference example of how to do Splinterlands style NFT pack
                issuance. The comments in the source code should give a good idea of how it works.

                Everything done in this example contract can be done just as well from Python or Javascript. It's worth
                repeating that all NFT interactions can be boiled down to simply broadcasting the appropriate custom
                json commands. It demonstrates the following features:

            <ul class="requirements">
                <li class="each-requirement">
                    allow NFT owner to configure different editions (think Splinterlands ALPHA, BETA, and UNTAMED)
                </li>
                <li class="each-requirement">
                    programmatically create the CRITTER NFT through a contract action
                </li>
                <li class="each-requirement">
                    open a "pack" to generate critters by randomly varying properties such as critter type, rarity, and
                    whether the critter is a gold foil or not.
                </li>
                <li class="each-requirement">
                    allow different pack tokens for each edition - the contract gives users a way to exchange pack
                    tokens for newly issued critters
                </li>
                <li class="each-requirement">
                    update data properties - a user can call a contract action to set a name for critters that he/she
                    owns
