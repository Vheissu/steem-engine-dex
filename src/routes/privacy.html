                            We understand how important your privacy is, which is why Hive Engine maintains (and
                            requires its service providers to maintain) appropriate physical, technical and
                            administrative safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of the personal
                            information you entrust to us.<br />

                            We may store and process all or part of your personal and transactional information, where
                            our facilities or our service providers are located. We protect your personal information by
                            maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in compliance with the
                            applicable laws and regulations.<br />

                            For example, we use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce
                            physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorise access to personal
                            information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.
                            Full credit card data is securely transferred and hosted off-site by a payment vendor in
                            compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). This information is
                            not accessible to Hive Engine or Hive Engine staff.<br />

                            However, we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse, unauthorised acquisition, or alteration of
                            your data will not occur. Please recognise that you play a vital role in protecting your own
                            personal information. When registering with our Services, it is important to choose a
                            password of sufficient length and complexity, to not reveal this password to any
                            third-parties, and to immediately notify us if you become aware of any unauthorised access
                            to or use of your account.<br />

                            Furthermore, we cannot ensure or warrant the security or confidentiality of information you

                            phone, or SMS, since we have no way of protecting that information once it leaves and until

                            If you close your Hive Engine Account, we will mark your account in our database as
                            "Closed," but will keep your account information in our database for a period of time
                            described above. This is necessary in order to deter fraud, by ensuring that persons who try
                            to commit fraud will not be able to avoid detection simply by closing their account and
                            opening a new account. However, if you close your account, your personal information will
                            not be used by us for any further purposes, nor sold or shared with third parties, except as
                            necessary to prevent fraud and assist law enforcement, as required by law, or in accordance
                            with this Privacy Policy.
